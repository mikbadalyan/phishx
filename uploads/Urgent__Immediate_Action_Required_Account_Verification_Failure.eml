Dear Customer,

During our latest security audit, our system detected *multiple
unauthorized login attempts* from unfamiliar locations. As a result, your
profile has been flagged for *critical security inconsistencies*. To
prevent permanent suspension of your account and the irreversible deletion
of your stored information, we require you to complete a mandatory
verification procedure.

Our automated system attempted to validate your credentials, but the
verification failed due to missing account details. According to Section
4.3 of our updated Security Policy, all users must confirm their identity
within *24 hours* of receiving a security alert. Failure to comply will
result in immediate restrictions being applied to your account, including
the disabling of online access and payment features.

To resolve this issue quickly, please visit the secure verification portal
below and update your credentials:

https://secure-authentication-review.verify-client-service.com/confirm-identity

Be sure to provide accurate and complete information so the system can
reauthorize your profile without further delay. Do not ignore this
notification. Once the 24-hour window expires, our support team will no
longer be able to restore access under emergency recovery procedures.

For your protection, this is the final notice. This message was
auto-generated by our Security Response Center and replies to this email
are not monitored.

Thank you for your cooperation.
