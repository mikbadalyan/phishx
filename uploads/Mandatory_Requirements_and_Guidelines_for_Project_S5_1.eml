Dear Students,
This email formally outlines the complete requirements and guidelines for P=
roject S5. This project is a capstone experience designed to integrate your=
 academic learning with practical, industry-relevant application, requiring=
 both technical execution and professional dissemination.
Please review all sections carefully, as adherence to these structured requ=
irements is mandatory.
1. Project Scope and Focus
All projects must directly address an ongoing problem in industry or societ=
y (e.g., healthcare, education, business process optimization, environmenta=
l sustainability).

  *   Synopsys Projects: Must be clearly defined sub-tasks or pilot project=
s derived from Synopsys's actual needs (e.g., in EDA tools, verification, o=
r internal systems).
  *   Own Projects: Must be based on a clear, validated problem statement w=
ith a potential path to real-world application or adoption.
  *   Deliverable: A demonstrable software-centric system, software, or ana=
lytical solution. Hardware/microelectronics involvement is permissible but =
secondary (e.g., embedded systems).

Please begin your project planning immediately, focusing on a clear problem=
 statement and a robust design that integrates a minimum of four course com=
petencies. If you have any questions regarding the scope or requirements, p=
lease consult with your course instructors.
The mentor for the Synopsys Armenia track is Vasgen Melikyan.
Students outside this track are required to contact a professor listed in t=
he CC field, finalize their topic with the prospective mentor's validation,=
 and complete the project form by October 6th.
https://forms.office.com/e/4uRp1jXYaL
Important: For team projects, which have a maximum limit of four students, =
each member is required to submit the form individually (separately), prese=
nt their unique part of the investigation, and be assigned a mentor, who ca=
n be the same person for all or different across the team.
2. Integration of Concurrent Course Competencies
The project must demonstrably leverage concepts from at least four of the c=
oncurrent courses.
Course
Potential Project Integration Example
Systems Programming
Low-level optimization, memory management, IPC, shell scripting for automat=
ion.
Parallel Programming
Multi-threading, multi-processing, GPU computing (OpenMP), synchronization =
techniques.
Functional Programming & Introduction to ADT
Use of immutable data structures, higher-order functions, or advanced ADT d=
esign.
Probability & Statistics
Data modeling, statistical testing, use of R or Python's Pandas/SciPy for a=
nalysis.
Graph Theory
Implementation of graph algorithms (shortest path, MST, flow networks) to m=
odel project data/systems.
Theory of Automata and Formal Languages
Use of regular expressions, design of a simple parser/lexer for a DSL or co=
nfiguration.
Computer Networks 3
Network protocol implementation, socket programming, distributed system arc=
hitecture, secure communication.
Object-Oriented Programming 2 (Java)
Adherence to SOLID principles, use of advanced Java features, robust class =
hierarchy.
Software Engineering
Application of a development methodology (Agile/Scrum), version control (Gi=
t), rigorous testing, requirements analysis, documentation.
Artificial Intelligence
Implementing ML models, search algorithms (A*, minimax), or NLP.

Crucially, the final report and presentation must explicitly map the projec=
t components to the respective course concepts.

3. External Engagement (Choose One)
The project must include an external validation or competitive element. You=
 must participate in one of the following:

  *   International Competition or Hackathon: Participation in a relevant p=
rogramming, microelectronic, or domain-specific competition (e.g., Kaggle, =
IEEE, ACM ICPC style, tech company hackathons).
     *   Evidence: Registration proof, submission details, participation ce=
rtificate/results.
  *   Start-up Product Presentation: Develop a business case and present th=
e product at a recognized local or international start-up event or pitch co=
mpetition.
     *   Evidence: Pitch deck, event details, photos/video of presentation.

4. Professional Dissemination (Choose One)
You must formally present and document your project findings to a professio=
nal audience by choosing one of the following:

  *   Poster Presentation: Design and present a professional Poster summari=
zing the problem, methodology, and results at a professional conference or =
university-level research day (online or offline).
  *   Article Summation and Presentation: Write a short Article Summation (=
e.g., 2-4 pages, conference paper format) and present the work (oral presen=
tation) at a professional conference or seminar (online or offline).
     *   Evidence: Conference program, abstract submission, presentation sl=
ides/video.

5. Required Deliverables
All deliverables must be completed and submitted by the final deadline:

  1.  Written Report (Formal Technical Document):
     *   Structure: Must include Problem Statement, Requirements, Design (A=
rchitecture, UML, Data Model), Implementation Details (Algorithms, Key Code=
 Snippets), Results, Testing/Evaluation, Integration of Competences Mapping=
 (Required Section), Conclusion, and Future Work.
     *   Appendices: A detailed mapping grid showing which course competenc=
ies were used and how is required.
  2.  Git/GitHub Repository: A complete, well-structured, and consistently =
committed source code repository with clear documentation (README.md), inst=
allation instructions, and a visible project history.
  3.  External Engagements Presentation (Proof of Participation): Compiled =
evidence (links, certificates, photos, videos) of the chosen External Engag=
ement and Professional Dissemination activities.
  4.  Oral Presentation and Demonstration (Final Defense): A 15-20 minute p=
resentation and live demonstration of the functional system/solution to the=
 project committee, followed by a Q&A session.
